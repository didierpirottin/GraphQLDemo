== Title

Efficient GraphQL Implementations: Leveraging Spring Boot and JooQ for Performance

== Elevator pitch

Discover how to implement a GraphQL data access service in Java using Spring Boot for GraphQL and JooQ for database access.

Join us as we uncover the most common performance issues in service implementation and unveil powerful techniques for optimizing your GraphQL performance.

This talk will be primarily a live coding presentation.

== Notes

To give an overview of my presentation proposal, I've taken the initiative of preparing a video.

I've also written a detailed step-by-step guide to the subject.

// TODO give the link to the github ?

I'm very excited to share this at the conference.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to suggest improvements to my proposal.

Kind regards,
Didier
